It's 7-11 Day! So let's have a gross hot dog and a Slurpee together

- [The Detroit Cobras - Baby](https://open.spotify.com/album/5O4k0CvkRkySoyjF07RwPc) : Great Garage Rock album that features a great song about eating hot dogs. 
I think there may be some sexual inuendo in there somewhere...who knows?
- [Iceage - Beyondless](https://open.spotify.com/album/5H8wFFblf7YvGc7LbBzuR9) : These Danish nutters evolved from awesome Noise Punk to more expansive rockers. Their on this list for two reasons: 1. This is an interesting album from a solid band 2. They have ice in their name which reminds me of Slurpees so...shut up! It's clever!
- [The Dead Kennedys - Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Xv8PCJ7ZMmRd3jXnJqg3V) : 7-11? Convenience Store? Get it! This is probably my favorite album from DK. A right awesome political/social commentary Punk rock album
