- [Iron Maiden - Seventh Son of the Seventh Son](https://open.spotify.com/album/4UWaqJplSqDf3hqlb0OdxR) : The last album of the great golden age of Iron Maiden, this release is a stunning concept album and an absolute tour de force for this band that is still performing after over 40 years in the business.
