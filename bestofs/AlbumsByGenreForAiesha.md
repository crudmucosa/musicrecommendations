## Heavy Metal/Metalcore
- [Iron Maiden - Seventh Son of the Seventh Son](https://open.spotify.com/album/4UWaqJplSqDf3hqlb0OdxR) : The last album of the great golden age of Iron Maiden, this release is a stunning concept album and an absolute tour de force for this band that is still performing after over 40 years in the business.
- [Black Sabbath - Paranoid](https://open.spotify.com/album/6r7LZXAVueS5DqdrvXJJK7) : Classic and influential Doom Metal album. A bit bluesy, a bit stoner, all metal.
- [Queensr√øche - Operation Mindcrime](https://open.spotify.com/album/16VzTNaeadMjxI03Xi9s6n) : Excellent concept album from these Power Metal legends. It tells a story and leaves one wanting more.
- [Walls of Jericho - With Devils Amongst Us All](https://open.spotify.com/album/5WJ9NSZdMK8VuEw5BKAEOI) : Female-fronted Metalcore with an explosive sound, anthemic lyrics, and raw intensity.
- [Judas Priest - Painkiller](https://open.spotify.com/album/7LgrhuKnAXpNEv8qzcVd2t) : A powerful Thrash/Speed Metal album that was the last one that the voice of Judas Priest (Rob Halford) helmed until the early 2000's. Catchy hooks and pure power. Rousing and inspirational throughout.
- [Nighwish - Once](https://open.spotify.com/album/0aDCpYtFdQ0S8C3oAtOonk) : Setting the standard for epic, Symphonic Metal, this album is full of dark drama and majesty. It has many layers but is imminently accessible.
